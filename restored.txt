 Charles, I thank thee...
 For for thy?
 love to.
 me, which.
 thou shalt find I will most kindly requite!?
 I had myself notice of?
 my brother's pur.
 pose herein?
 and aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaa have by underh.
 and means laboured to!
 dissuade him from it, but he is resolute.
 I'll tell thee, Charles: it is the stubbornest young aaaaaaa fellow of France, full of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against me his natural brother: therefore use thy discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger.
 And thou wert best look to't; for if thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap thee ssssssssss.
 ddd by some treacherous device and never leave thee till he hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other; for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak it, there is not one so young and so villanous this day living.
 I speak but brotherly of him; but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.
 apdlas.
 dddddddddd sadasd.
